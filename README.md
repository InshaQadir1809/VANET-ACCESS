The Zero Trust model ensures that no entity is trusted by default, requiring continuous authentication and validation. In this Python implementation, the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) algorithm provides lightweight, efficient security. ECC generates public-private key pairs for secure communication, key exchange, and digital signatures. These are used to authenticate users and devices, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data. Once authenticated, access is granted based on predefined security policies. By combining Zero Trust with ECC, the system enhances security with lower computational overhead, making it ideal for protecting sensitive information in resource-constrained environments.
